![](/InstantLingua.png)

Inspired by the official [Instant Translate](https://www.popclip.app/extensions/x/08hhdb) and [OpenAI Chat](https://www.popclip.app/extensions/x/48f32j) extensions, **InstantLingua** is a powerful PopClip extension that provides seamless language assistance.  

With built-in support for **OpenAI, Claude, Grok, Gemini, and Ollama (local)**, InstantLingua enables instant translation, grammar correction, text rewriting, summarization, and smart reply suggestions—all directly within PopClip.

## Features

- **Instant Translation** – Quickly translate selected text between multiple languages
- **Bilingual Comparison** – Display original text alongside translation for easy reference (Note: Due to PopClip's display limitations, use "Display and Copy" or "Paste to Cursor" mode for full viewing)
- **Grammar Check** – Improve your writing with AI-powered grammar corrections (English Only)
- **Reply Suggestions** – Generate intelligent reply recommendations for messages and emails (English Only)
- **Text Rewrite** – Rewrite your text in different styles like professional, concise, or more descriptive
- **Summarize** – Get concise summaries of long texts
- **Custom Prompt** – Define your own AI instructions for custom text processing
- **Multi-Provider Support** – Use OpenAI, Claude, Grok, Gemini, or Ollama (local) models for language tasks
- **Paste Mode** – Paste results directly to cursor position
- **Dialog Window** – Display results in a floating panel for longer content
  - Floating panel appears near cursor
  - Bilingual view with language detection labels
  - Text-to-speech for original and translation
  - Quick copy buttons for each section
  - Click outside or press `Esc` to close, `Return` to confirm, `Cmd+C` to copy translation
- **Auto-Dialog Threshold** – Automatically switch to Dialog Window when output exceeds the threshold (default: 200 chars). This ensures long responses are always readable with proper text wrapping. Set to 0 to disable.
